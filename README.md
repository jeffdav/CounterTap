CounterTap
==========

Simple app for keeping track of how many times things happen.

Also an excuse to play with CorePlot.

Mostly everything works.  Export as CSV is commented out.  Graphing is non-optimal and could look a lot better if someone were to tweak the multitude of parameters that are available for tweaking.

Refactoring for having groups of counters was begun, but hasn't been completed.  That would be the next major UI workitem other than graphing.

If anyone wants to contribute, feel free.  I probably won't have time to get back to this.
